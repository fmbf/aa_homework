# Exercise 1 - Stack

# Let's write a Stack class. To do this, use the following framework:
# To test that your code works,
# create a new instance of the Stack class,
# and play around with adding and removing elements.
# Remember, a stack follows the principle of LIFO!

  class Stack
    def initialize
      # create ivar to store stack here!
    end

    def add(el)
      # adds an element to the stack
    end

    def remove
      # removes one element from the stack
    end

    def show
      # return a copy of the stack
    end
  end
